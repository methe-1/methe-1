#### 2. Just recreated a combined SSR & CSR small Next App [Check Code](https://github.com/methe-1/Next-Combine-SSR-With-SSG) 
- I created a UI component that can take data as prop either from a Server-Side Component or a Client-Side Component. 
- The data is fetched and stored using Redux/toolkits.
